</div>

This is a simple YouTube clone project that I built while learning the basics of HTML and CSS. The project replicates the layout and design of YouTube's homepage, focusing on core structural elements like a navigation bar, video thumbnails, and a footer.

## Technologies Used
* HTML: Structure of the webpage.
* CSS: Styling of the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive behavior.
